# habit-tracker
build a monthly tracking journal
- add habits you are tracking for every day of a month
	- ex: working out, leetcode, reading a book
- mark consistency over a month 
	- some cool graphs?
- log "productivity" times throughout the day
	- show how consistent you are a time
- include goals for a month
	- AI features that can "create" a roadmap to accomplish this over a month
- record a highlight of the day
	- include a reflection of the day feature?
- should look like a notebook, where you can flip through pages
    - on clicking a date, we can "log" information about the productivity and highlights for the day
